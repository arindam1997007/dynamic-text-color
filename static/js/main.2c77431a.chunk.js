The best way to learn something is by doing. So, let\u2019s build a simple Blog app using React to understand how things work. We won\u2019t be making a very feature-rich blogging website with cool designs and all. Instead, it would be simple \u2014 to serve the purpose of learning. It would be a simple blog website with very few functionalities, enabling you to learn better. The features we are going to build into this blog are:- Fetching blogs from a local JSON server and displaying the blogs in list form. Fetching details about individual blogs and displaying them. Adding new blogs. Deleting blogs. It would be pure React, and we will not be using any backend server for this blogging website. So, the changes we make, i.e. the blogs we delete or add, will reset once the page is refreshed. So, it won\u2019t be saving any data on any server. This article series is aimed at beginners currently, so we would go into all the things In detail so that you can understand how things work and will be able to implement more features into it. In the initial phase of this tutorial series, we will only use React with no backend or cloud to store any data. It all gets reset once we refresh the page. But, later on, I plan to add a backend to this React project to make it full-stack. We will use Express, Node.js, and MongoDB to build the backend for this application and then connect the front-end and back-end. Furthermore, if the article series gets a good response, I would add some more features into the series with more parts, including authentication and some other features to make it more practical. But we keep these things for a later date and may or may not be added. So, let\u2019s focus on the initial phase for now, which is primarily aimed at beginners."})}}]),a}(o.Component),w=p;var f=function(){return Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(h.jsx)(g,{}),Object(h.jsx)(w,{}),Object(h.jsx)(m,{})]})},y=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,16)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,o=t.getFID,n=t.getFCP,i=t.getLCP,r=t.getTTFB;a(e),o(e),n(e),i(e),r(e)}))};r.a.render(Object(h.jsx)(n.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(h.jsx)(f,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),y()}},[[15,1,2]]]);
